  HTML Map and Contact Form Code-along
  Objectives
  Embed Google Map as an iframe
  Creating a Contact Form
  Introduction
  Building upon previous code alongs, in this exercise you will add an embedded iframe map by coding along with the video provided, reviewing the concepts you were introduced to in the previous lessons.

  Instructions
  Either run the learn open command or manually open the lab.
  Code along with the provided video below and/or its supplementary reading located below the video. Code everything you see there. Feel free to stop, pause, rewind or fast forward through the content to keep pace.

  NOTE: The Google Maps interface has changed slightly since this video was recorded. We'll re-record the video ASAP, but we're sure you can find your way around (the changes are minimal and intuitive).

  Map Embed
  Start by creating a new feature branch in Terminal by typing git checkout -b contact-page.

  Then open the contact.html page in your code editor. Under the <h3>Contact</h3> write some comments for the content we will add like so,


  <h3>Contact</h3>

  <!-- Map -->

  <!-- Contact Form -->

  Next, in your browser head to https://www.google.com/maps and search for a general location. I searched for Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn, NY.

  Now click the menu icon located at the top left of the screen and select Share or embed map. Then click the Embed map tab.

  Next to the link with the iframe code click the drop menu to select the size of the iframe and choose Custom size. Then set the width to 425 pixels wide and set the height to 350 pixels tall. Then highlight the iframe embed code and copy it to your clipboard using Command + c (Mac) or Ctrl + c (Windows) and the head back to your code editor and paste the code snippet Command + v (Mac) or Ctrl + v (Windows) under the comment <!--map--> like so,


  <!-- Map -->
  <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d6049.881319200985!2d-74.00151372674895!3d40.69730452928296!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x89c25a47df06b185%3A0xc889234bc07c42ee!2sBrooklyn+Heights%2C+Brooklyn%2C+NY+11201!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1461598289488" width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  This long code snippet uses the <iframe> element that allows us to load another HTML page inside of a frame within our HTML page. It is like looking through a window from our page into another page displaying a Google Map.

  Next go ahead and save this page and preview it in the browser. The map should look something like this:


  Looks good! Let's stage and commit our code. In Terminal type git add contact.html and press return. Then type git commit -m "add google map to contact page" and press return. Then we will push up our feature branch as a backup for safe keeping, type git push -u origin contact-page and press return.

  Form
  Next let's add a contact form. Under our <!-- Contact Form --> comment let's start by creating a <form> element. This will wrap all of our form inputs.


  <!-- Contact Form -->
  <form>...</form>

  We need to give our opening form element two attributes. The first is an action which is the location that our form will submit its input information to. In our case we will be submitting to a PHP script that will send an email later on. For now, we will insert a # pound sign as a placeholder. Second, we will include the method attribute. This tells the browser the type of request we are making to the location we are submitting in the action. Here we will set the value as post.


  <!-- Contact Form -->
  <form action="#" method="post">
    ...
  </form>

  Next, we would like to create inputs for the user to insert their name, email, phone, and a message. We will start by adding a label and input for fullname like so,


  <!-- Contact Form -->
  <form action="#" method="post">
    <label for="fullname">Name</label>
    <input type="text" id="fullname" name="fullname" placeholder="your name" required>
  </form>

  On line 3 we use a <label> element to create a text label associated with the form input. By using the for attribute set on the label to match the value of the id attribute in the input this ties the label to the input so that if a user clicks on the text of the label "Name" it will select the input next to it. You can test this on the example below:

  Name
  your name

  The required attribute on line 4 helps us alert the user when they try to submit the form without filling out their name.

  Let's fill in the rest of our inputs.


  <!-- Contact Form -->
